## 👋 Hi, I'm Kirill

I'm a software engineer and I love programming! Currently I'm interested in web development and discover various technologies including Svelte, React, Vue and others, another interest I have is backend development with Go and Java/Kotlin in particular. My primary stack as of today for my side projects is Svelte, Go and PostgreSQL. 

I greatly appreciate open-source community and admire the developers who are constantly contributing to the open-source development. Lately I have been excited to work with Linux and its ecosystem, currently using Arch Linux on my devices.
